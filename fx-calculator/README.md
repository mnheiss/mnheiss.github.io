FX-Calculator for the study to learn about PWAs.
With the structure including the docs folder, the github-page doesn't worked in my case, nor I found a way to choose the /docs of the master branch (maybe not possible with free account?). So I'm sorry for the unstructured repository. 

In the repository there are two png files of the lighthouse-test-result. The lower value of the best practices is about http1 requests instead of http2, as you can see there.
